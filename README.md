# Generative AI Blog Generation Application on AWS

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end serverless generative AI application on AWS to automatically generate blog content. Users can send a query via an API, which triggers a Lambda function. This function then leverages foundation models from Amazon Bedrock to generate the blog post and stores the result in an S3 bucket.

This README provides a guide to understanding the architecture, services used, and the steps involved in developing and testing this application.

## Architecture

The application follows this high-level architecture:

1.  **User/Client (e.g., Postman)**: Sends a POST request with a query/topic for the blog post.
2.  **Amazon API Gateway**: Receives the request, acts as the front door for the application, and triggers the AWS Lambda function.
3.  **AWS Lambda**:
    * Receives the query from API Gateway.
    * Interacts with Amazon Bedrock, sending the query to a chosen foundational model.
    * Receives the generated blog content from Bedrock.
    * Saves the generated blog content as a file (text/PDF) in an Amazon S3 bucket, timestamped for uniqueness.
4.  **Amazon Bedrock**: Provides access to various foundational models (e.g., Llama 3, Anthropic Claude) that generate the blog content based on the prompt.
5.  **Amazon S3**: Stores the generated blog files.

## AWS Services Used

* **Amazon API Gateway**: To create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
* **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
* **Amazon Bedrock**: A fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies via a single API.
* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: To store and retrieve any amount of data, such as the generated blog files.
* **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: To securely manage access to AWS services and resources (implicitly used for Lambda permissions).
* **Amazon CloudWatch**: For monitoring, logging, and debugging the Lambda function and API Gateway.

## Core Components & Logic

### API Gateway
* Serves as the HTTP endpoint for users.
* Configured to trigger the Lambda function upon receiving a request (e.g., a POST request to `/generate-blog`).
* Passes user input (the blog topic/query) to the Lambda function.

### AWS Lambda
* The core compute engine where the blog generation logic resides.
* Benefits: Automatic scaling, pay-per-use, no server management.
* Responsible for:
    * Parsing the input query.
    * Formatting the prompt for the Bedrock model.
    * Invoking the chosen foundational model in Bedrock.
    * Storing the generated content in S3.

### Amazon Bedrock
* Provides access to a variety of foundational models (e.g., Llama 3, Anthropic models) for text generation.
* The Lambda function will specify which model to use and provide the necessary parameters (prompt, max generation length).

### Amazon S3
* Used for persistent storage of the generated blog posts.
* Files are typically timestamped to ensure unique filenames and allow for easy retrieval.
* Bucket names must be globally unique.

## Prerequisites

* An active AWS Account.
* AWS CLI configured locally (optional, but helpful).
* Postman (or any API client) for testing the API.
* Basic understanding of Python programming.
* Access to foundational models within Amazon Bedrock enabled in your AWS account and region.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

(This section would typically link to the actual code or provide more detailed AWS console steps based on the tutorial video)

### 1. Setting up Amazon Bedrock Access
* Ensure that you have requested and been granted access to the desired foundational models (e.g., Llama 3, Anthropic Claude) in the AWS region you are working in. This is done via the Amazon Bedrock console.

### 2. Creating the S3 Bucket
* Navigate to the S3 console in AWS.
* Create a new bucket.
    * **Bucket Name**: Must be globally unique (e.g., `my-generative-ai-blogs-<random-string>`).
    * **Region**: Choose your preferred region.
* Note the bucket name as it will be needed in the Lambda function.

### 3. Developing the AWS Lambda Function
* Navigate to the AWS Lambda console.
* Create a new function:
    * **Name**: e.g., `BlogGenerationFunction`.
    * **Runtime**: Python 3.12.
    * **Architecture**: Choose appropriate (e.g., x86_64).
    * **Permissions**: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions. This role will need to be modified later to grant access to Amazon Bedrock and the S3 bucket created in step 2.
* Write the Python code for the function (see [Lambda Function Details](#lambda-function-details)).
* **Add Permissions to Lambda Role**:
    * Go to the IAM console, find the role created for the Lambda function.
    * Attach policies that allow:
        * `bedrock:InvokeModel` (or more specific model invocation permissions).
        * `s3:PutObject` for the specific S3 bucket.
* **Environment Variables** (Recommended):
    * `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket.
    * `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`: The ID of the Bedrock model you want to use (e.g., `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0` or `meta.llama3-8b-instruct-v1:0`).

### 4. Creating the API with API Gateway
* Navigate to the API Gateway console.
* Create a new API (e.g., REST API).
    * **API Name**: e.g., `BlogGeneratorAPI`.
* Create a resource (e.g., `/blog`).
* Create a method under the resource (e.g., `POST`).
    * **Integration Type**: Lambda Function.
    * **Use Lambda Proxy integration**: Checked.
    * **Lambda Function**: Select the `BlogGenerationFunction` created earlier.
* Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., `dev` or `prod`).
* Note the **Invoke URL** provided after deployment.

## Lambda Function Details

### Runtime
* Python 3.12

### Core Logic

Error Handling

    A try-catch (try-except in Python) block is implemented in the Lambda function to handle potential errors during model invocation or S3 operations.
    Errors are logged to CloudWatch.

Permissions

The Lambda execution role requires permissions to:

    Invoke Amazon Bedrock models (e.g., bedrock:InvokeModel).
    Write objects to the designated S3 bucket (e.g., s3:PutObject).
    Write logs to CloudWatch Logs (usually granted by default).

Testing the Application

    Obtain the Invoke URL from your deployed API Gateway stage.
    Use Postman (or a similar API client) to send a POST request to the Invoke URL (e.g., https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>/blog).
    Set the request body to JSON, providing the query:
    JSON

{
    "query": "Write a short blog post about the future of serverless computing.",
    "max_tokens": 500 
}

Check the response from the API. A successful response (HTTP 200) should indicate that the blog was generated.
Verify that a new file (e.g., blog_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.txt) has been created in your S3 bucket with the generated content.
